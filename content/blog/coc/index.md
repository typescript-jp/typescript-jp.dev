## A More In-depth Look at Our Code of Conduct

Let’s take a closer look at what we consider harassment and our zero-tolerance policy.

## What is considered harassing behavior?

- Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity, and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities.

## Reporting

Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place. If you feel uncomfortable, are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a TSConf organizer or volunteer immediately. Organizers and volunteers will be wearing specific badges, shirts, or other identifiable items to help you find them. If you can’t find an organizer or volunteer, TSConf on Twitter has DMs open and is monitored constantly. Our team will be happy to help you contact security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
